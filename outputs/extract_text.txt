we live this one routine of a day for 75 years and we call it life no that's not life if you're still thinking why you have been sent here if you're still juggling with the concept of why you were here you haven't lived yet you work hard you make money you do it for yourself that's not life you go out you seek for people who need your help you make their lives better you become that sponge which can absorb all the negativity and you become that person who can emit beautiful positive vibes and when you realize that you have changed someone's life and because of you this person didn't give up that is the day when you live always you
