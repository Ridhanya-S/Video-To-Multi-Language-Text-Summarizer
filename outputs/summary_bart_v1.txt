we live this one routine of a day for 75 years and we call it life no that's not life if you're still thinking why you have been sent here you haven't lived yet. You go out you seek for people who need your help you make their lives better. When you realize that you have changed someone's life and because of you this person didn't give up that is the day when you live always you. You become that sponge which can absorb all the negativity and you become that person who can emit beautiful positive vibes. That is the way to live always and always.
